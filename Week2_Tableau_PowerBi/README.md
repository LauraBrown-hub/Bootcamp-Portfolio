# Bootcamp- Week 2
This is a project for Week 2 of a course I have recently studied.

It covers a range of tasks focusing on data analysis, visualisation, and using specific tools like Tableau and Power BI.

## Key Topics and Skills Demonstrated

### Data Visualization and Analysis in Tableau

- Researching and comparing different Tableau versions, specifically the limited functionality of 'Tableau Public'.
- Creating a dashboard using the `EMSI_JobChange_UK` dataset, including:
  - A bar chart for percentage change.
  - A UK-based map showing impacted city locations.
- Conducting analysis on a Spotify dataset to find trends and key information for organisational use.
- Conducting analysis on a Health dataset to find trends and reflecting on how this data could support NHS decision-making.

### Power BI Labs

- Get Data in Power BI Desktop.
- Load Transformed Data in Power BI Desktop.
- Design a Report in Power BI Desktop.
- Create a Power BI Dashboard.

## Portfolio Value

This workbook demonstrates practical skills in data manipulation, trend analysis, and the creation of business-ready dashboards and reports using industry-standard tools like Tableau and Power BI. It highlights an ability to:

- Handle, analyse, and interpret real-world datasets (e.g., job change data, Spotify music data, and health data).
- Apply best practices in data preparation and transformation within Power BI.
- Design and create effective data reports and dashboards for stakeholders.
- Critically evaluate data tools and their limitations (e.g., Tableau versions).
