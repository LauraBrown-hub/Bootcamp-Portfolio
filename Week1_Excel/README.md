# Bootcamp - Week 1
This project serves as a record of skills acquired during a data course. It documents proficiency across several key areas: understanding data regulation (GDPR, Data Protection Act), fundamental Excel skills like sorting, calculating sums and averages, advanced analysis using Pivot Tables and the SWITCH function, and creating data visualisations. The workbook culminates in a task focused on developing professional communication and presentation strategies for conveying data findings to senior leadership.

The initial task focused on understanding the legal framework for handling customer data. This section demonstrates knowledge of key UK legislation and European regulations, including:

- **Data Protection Act 2018**: Governs how personal data is gathered, processed, and stored, ensuring data is handled lawfully and securely within the GDPR framework.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Ensures personal data is used fairly, lawfully, and transparently, giving individuals rights over their data.
- **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)**: Grants the public the right to request information from most UK public authorities to promote accountability and transparency.
- **Computer Misuse Act (CMA)**: Makes unauthorised access to computer material and data manipulation illegal, protecting against cybercrime.

**Excel Data Manipulation**

These tasks focus on foundational data manipulation skills in Excel using two different datasets:

**Retail Sales Dataset (Task 1):**
- Creating an Excel Table.
- Sorting data (e.g., Age column from largest to smallest).
- Using the SUM function (to find commission total).
- Using the AVERAGE function (to find the average commission).

**Student Scores Dataset (Task 2):**
- Applying filtering and sorting to identify the best students.
- Calculating averages using a formula.
- Using the MAX function to find the highest score.
- Applying conditional formatting to highlight the highest and lowest average scores.

**Data Analysis and Categorisation**

**Pivot Tables (Task 1 & 2):**
- Creating and configuring a Pivot Table to summarise data.
- Analysing results from a Bike Sales Pivot Table, including market analysis by country, age group, and gender.
- Summarising sales data by county (rows) and product (columns) using Sales Volume (values).

**SWITCH Function (Task 2):**
- Using the Excel SWITCH function with nested logic (=SWITCH(TRUE, C2 > 600, "High", C2 >= 300, "Medium", "Low")) to categorise Sales Volume into "High," "Medium," or "Low" tiers.

**Data Visualisation**

This task focuses on translating data into visual formats for easier interpretation:
- Creating a line chart to compare Annual Profit vs. Annual Revenue over time (2017–2021).
- Creating a pie chart to show Revenue Comparison by Age Group.

**Presentation and Communication**

The final task addresses the crucial soft skill of communicating data insights to senior leadership:

- **Presentation Preparation**: Researching stakeholders (prospecting), building a narrative, and structuring the delivery (problem, data, solution).
- **Tools for Delivery**: Identifying appropriate tools like PowerPoint, Google Slides, PowerBI, Tableau, Canva, Visme, Teams, or Zoom.
- **Best Practices for Public Speaking**: Emphasising confidence, rehearsal, conciseness, visual simplicity, and engaging the audience.
- **Articulation of Findings**: Proposing solutions with predicted outcomes, such as loyalty-based renewal offers, and backing them up with data and visualisations.
